Thank you for downloading BattleZone NWAF for Xbox One/SeriesX/S Created by TL Actual Gaming.
A few things to note before doing anything, make sure to create a backup of all of your
files before uploading anything.

Make sure with the Globals file, you upload it to the "db" folder AND your "dayz.offlinechernarusplus" folder.


The cfggameplay and CHERNARUScfggameplay files have to be the same (all text should be the same)
They get uploaded into the "dayz.offlinechernarusplus" folder.

Cfgplayerspawnpoints should go into the "dayz.offlinechernarusplus" folder.

Battlezone.json and Weaponshack.json need to be uploaded to the "custom" folder.

After uploading everything where it needs to go, restart your server or if you stopped your server
prior to uploading these files, simply start it back up. 

Everything should work properly after uploading. If something doesnt work, reinstall your server on 
Nitrado, then reupload everything, then restart the server.

If you have any issues feel free to DM me on IG @TL_Actual_Gaming and I will get to you as soon
as I can.
